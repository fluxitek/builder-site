title: Introduction

Builder is a framework for building measurement applications.

Define measurement parameter fields + curves and result values to show. Create
reports the way you want them, integrate to Excel and CSV.

Getting data in
---------------

You’ve ran through Getting started - now you have your desktop app. Next obvious
question: How do I get data into it?

If you don’t set Builder up with a data source, it sends you recorded data. You
probably don’t want that.

To get your own data into Builder, you need to have a data source. Builder
doesn’t care about where the data comes from. It only provides you with an
interface to send the data to the UI for Builder to display and store to its
database, for later browsing and reporting of the measurement results.

By default, Builder shows the measurement data you send on real-time value
displays and in the curve.

If you like, this is all you need to send. Optionally, you can create result
fields and add simple control to drive and tare actuators you have. Result
fields allow you to show individual result values in reporting.

Branding
--------

Builder can be fully branded into your own product. The product that Builder was
built from can be found here. Builder is time tested and usability verified.
Usability testing of your final customized product

You can customize everything where it counts.

The core functionality is in the testing app and the reporting app. These too
can be renamed to whatever you want.
