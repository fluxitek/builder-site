title: Getting Started: App Definitions, Project types, and Parameters
---


All measurement data is gathered within a project.

Projects have a type. 

They can also have a secondary type, i.e. in materials testing the project type may be "Metal strength pull test" and the secondary type is the type of test piece to be tested, i.e. "Round cross section rod". 

An App Definition is where you build your app. Project types and secondary types are defined before running your app, in App Definition. A project type defines: 

- Which parameters each test within that project has (i.e. in materials testing it can be speed, force, acceleration, etc.)
- Which curves are to be drawn during the test
- Which numeric displays are shown during the test

While running the app, when a user selects a project type to use for a project, the above details are selected for that project with it among others.

For each test that is run, all the parameter fields have values. Each project type and secondary type has default values for these values in App Definition. In addition, you can save sets of values as templates, in effect having a selections of default values for different situations.

When the number of projects grows, users can  optionally be organize them into a hierarchy of folders (or tags).
