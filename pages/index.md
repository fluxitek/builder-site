title: "Framework for building 
measurement applications
with superb UX"
---

## Introduction
 
**Create your desktop application for any measurement**. Define custom parameters, curves, and result values to show. Create reports the way you want them, integrate to Excel and CSV.

Builder is a framework for building measurement apps. It provides 

* GUI with your custom elements
 * Calibration
 * Measurement and device control / positioning
 * Reporting and data export to CSV / Excel
* installer if you are on Windows, 
* database with your custom structure (defaults to SQLite)

Simple on the outside, robust on the inside, Builder was originally built for industrial materials testing. 


Here's the main application window. You can drop any of the buttons if you like.

Create new project window. There are two pages here. The first page shows general settings for the project. 

The second page is for your custom parameters. If you like, the layout here can be entirely customized by creating your own .ui file.

Here's a project open in the main application window. 

## Usage: Getting started


[More details]

1. Include builder headers

```C++
#include builder/builder.h
```

Instantiate global config for current measurement app

```C++
bAppConfig appConfig;
```

Define one or more measurement 

```C++
Measurement m;
```

Instantiate some parameter field data

```C++
// Create parameter, give it field name for db fields
Param param;
param.fieldName="initialForce";
// UI visible name
param.fieldLabel=tr("Initial force");
```

Instantiate curves that current measurement has

Instantiate real-time value dsplays

Add all data objects to the Measurement object

```C++
m.addParam(param);
m.addCurve(curve);
m.addLCDNumber(display);
```

Add each measurement object to app global config

```C++
appConfig.addMeasurement(m);
```

Create Control process and UI

```C++
// bind process to UI
tester.setProcess(process);
tester.show();
